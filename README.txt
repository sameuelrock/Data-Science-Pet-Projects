README

Hi, I am Rock, currently an undergraduate Physics student. 
I made this repository to document what I learned as I pursue my Data Science career.
I genuinely had fun working on these, improving as I go, fixing bugs as I encounter them.
I thoroughly written here my thought process as how I understand the code, and how it serves my objective.
I hope you learn a thing or two from these, as I did while doing programming.
